My name is Nuno Martins and I'm a Software Engineer living in Lisbon, Portugal.  

I have 10 years of professional experience working with Java/Spring, building complex 
systems for banks and retail. I'm mostly experienced in software development but I also have skils and experience in business analysis and leadership.

I am interested in topics related with general programming, software architecture, cloud services and DevOps.

Currently I'm attending a <a href="https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/devops-bootcamp" target="_blank">DevOps Bootcamp</a> to gain additional insights and experience in this area. You can track my progress on <a href="https://github.com/users/ngmmartins/projects/8" target="_blank">this GitHub Project</a> or go straight to <a href="https://github.com/ngmmartins/twn-devops-bootcamp" target="_blank">my personal notes and exercises repository</a>.
I strive for knowing all phases related with the software development lifecycle. So expect some adjustments in my career development expectations in the near future.

My name is Nuno Martins and I'm a Software Engineer living in Lisbon, Portugal.
I have 8+ years of professional experience working with Java/Spring, building complex 
systems for banks and retail.

I am interested in topics related with general programming, software architecture, cloud services and DevOps.

Recently I am exploring the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/){:target="_blank"} programming language and enjoying it a lot!

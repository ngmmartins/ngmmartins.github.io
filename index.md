My name is Nuno Martins and I'm a Software Engineer living in Lisbon, Portugal.  

I have 10 years of professional experience working with Java/Spring, building complex 
systems for banks and retail. I'm experienced in all phases of the software development life cycle.

I am interested in topics related with general programming, software architecture, cloud services and DevOps.

At this time I'm looking for opportunities to work on a more business/people oriented role while still leveraging
my technical background to improve communication between both sides

My name is Nuno Martins and I'm a Software Engineer living in Lisbon, Portugal.  

I have 9+ years of professional experience working with Java/Spring, building complex 
systems for banks and retail.

I am interested in topics related with general programming, software architecture, cloud services and DevOps.

Recently I am exploring the [Go](https://golang.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/){:target="_blank"} programming languages and enjoying them a lot!

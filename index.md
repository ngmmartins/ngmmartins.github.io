My name is Nuno Martins and I'm a Software Engineer living in Lisbon, Portugal.  

I have 10 years of professional experience working with Java/Spring, building complex 
systems for banks and retail. I'm mostly experienced in software development but I also have skils and experience in business analysis and leadership.

I am interested in topics related with general programming, software architecture, cloud services and DevOps.

Currently I'm attending a DevOps Bootcamp to gain additional insights and experience in this area. I strive for knowing all phases related 
with the software development lifecycle. So expect some adjustments in my career development expectations in the near future.
